# PawFinder

This is a single-page web application designed to facilitate dog adoptions. It provides a platform for users to search for dogs available for adoption, create profiles, and finalize the adoption process. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and incorporates GraphQL for efficient data handling.

## Features

The Dog Adoption Web Application offers the following features:

1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for dogs based on their breed or name using the search bar.

2. **Cart**: Users can add dogs they are interested in adopting to the cart, allowing them to finalize the adoption process.

3. **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles, log in, and sign up to gain access to additional features and personalize their adoption experience.

4. **Front-end with React**: The application's front-end is built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.

5. **Back-end with GraphQL**: The server is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with data management handled through GraphQL queries and mutations.

6. **Database with MongoDB**: The application utilizes MongoDB as the database, and data interactions are facilitated using the Mongoose ODM.

7. **Authentication with JWT**: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to user profiles and adoption functionality.

8. **Deployment on Heroku**: The application is deployed on Heroku, allowing users to access it online.
